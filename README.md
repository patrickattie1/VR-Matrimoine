# VR-HaitianHistoryGallery1-AmericanOccupation, Virtual Gallery as a tribute to the Haitian history, American Occupation, February 2020

Created for CIHDICA in February 2020

This application's objective is to promote the Haitian history using virtual reality. CIHDICA has been providing content such as archive photos and videos on the subject.

In VR, using an Oculus Quest head mounted display and both its hand controllers (left and right), the user can use the thumbstick on the hand controllers to move around the main scene and push the thumbstick down to accelerate the movement (speedx3, for longer distances)


Inside the gallery, the user can see videos applied as textures on virtual movie screens and more than 120 photos from archives provided by CIHDCICA.

This VR application was designed using Unity 2019.2.0f1.

It was built for the folowing platforms:
- Desktop (Windows 10)
- WebGL original version (visible at: https://patrickattie.itch.io/HaitiOccupationAmericain, password = hocupame)
- Oculus Quest head mounted display and left and right hand controllers (buttons used: thumbstick)
